1-:difference between nodejs and javascript
JavaScript and Node.js are both important technologies in web development, but they have different purposes. JavaScript is a programming language that is used on the client-side, 
while Node.js is a runtime environment that is used on the server-side.
Feature	JavaScript	Node.js
Purpose	Used on the client-side to create interactive web pages	Used on the server-side to create web applications and other network-based applications
Programming model	Single-threaded, synchronous	Single-threaded, asynchronous
I/O model	Blocking	Non-blocking
Event handling	Event-driven	Event-driven
Libraries	Large library of modules available in the npm package manager	Smaller library of modules available in the npm package manager
Applications	Used to create web pages, web applications, and mobile applications	Used to create web applications, real-time applications, and other network-based applications
Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

Javascript:
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that it is executed in the user's browser. Node.js is a server-side runtime environment, which means that it is executed on the server.
JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means that it can only execute one task at a time. Node.js is also a single-threaded language, but it uses a technique called event looping to handle multiple concurrent requests.
JavaScript uses a blocking I/O model, which means that it will wait for an operation to complete before it can start another operation. Node.js uses a non-blocking I/O model, which means that it can start another operation without waiting for the previous operation to complete.
JavaScript uses an event-driven architecture, which means that it responds to events rather than polling for them. Node.js also uses an event-driven architecture.

2-:what is nodejs explain in details
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications.

Here are some of the key features of Node.js:

Asynchronous programming: Node.js uses an asynchronous programming model, which means that it can handle multiple requests at the same time without blocking. This makes it ideal for applications that need to handle a lot of concurrent traffic.
Event-driven architecture: Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, which means that it responds to events rather than polling for them. This makes it more efficient and responsive.
Single-threaded: Node.js is a single-threaded application, but it can handle multiple concurrent requests by using a technique called event looping.
Cross-platform: Node.js is a cross-platform application, which means that it can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems.
Large library of modules: Node.js has a large library of modules that can be used to extend its functionality. These modules can be found in the npm package manager.





















Javascript Programs
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._behavior = 0;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  get behavior() {
    return this._behavior;
  }   

  incrementBehavior() {
    this._behavior ++;
  }
}

const halley = new Dog('Halley');
console.log(halley.name); // Print name value to console
console.log(halley.behavior); // Print behavior value to console
halley.incrementBehavior(); // Add one to behavior
console.log(halley.name); // Print name value to console
console.log(halley.behavior); // Print behavior value to console


class Surgeon {
  constructor(name, department) {
    this._name = name;
    this._department = department;
    this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
  }
  
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  
  get department() {
    return this._department;
  }
  
  get remainingVacationDays() {
    return this._remainingVacationDays;
  }
  
  takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
    this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
  }
}

const surgeonRomero = new Surgeon('Francisco Romero', 'Cardiovascular');
const surgeonJackson = new Surgeon('Ruth Jackson', 'Orthopedics');
we also prepended our property names with underscores (_name and _behavior),
which indicate these properties should not be accessed directly. Under the getters, we add a method named .incrementBehavior(). When you call .incrementBehavior() on a Dog instance,
it adds 1 to the _behavior property. Between each of our methods, we did not include commas.

   constructor(name){
    this._name=name;
     this._remainingVacationDays=20;
